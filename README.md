# Crypto Portfolio Tracker
### This is a basic frontend project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to track their cryptocurrency holdings with real-time data updates.
#### Some of its key features include :

##### #Pie-chart visualization of your portfolio
##### #Automatic data refresh every 30 seconds, fetching the latest info from a cryptocurrency API
##### #Error handling for failed API requests or invalid data entered by the user
##### #Simple and user-friendly interface

As a learner, this project reflects my journey in web development while exploring APIs, data visualization, and robust error handling!
